        <p>
          CLIENT (DEFINED BELOW) AGREES THAT BY PLACING AN ORDER WITH 10ZING
          DIGITAL THROUGH A STATEMENT OF WORK (DEFINED BELOW) CLIENT SHALL
          FOLLOW AND BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SUCH STATEMENT(S)
          OF WORK AND THESE TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS. IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS PLACING
          AN ORDER ON BEHALF OF AN ORGANIZATION, SUCH INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS THAT
          HE/SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ORGANIZATION TO THE TERMS AND
          CONDITIONS OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK AND THESE TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS.

        <p>
          These Terms &amp; Conditions create a contract between 10ZING Digital
          LLC, a Utah limited liability company (hereinafter “<i
            ><b>10ZING Digital</b></i
          >”) and the “<i><b>Client</b></i
          >” indicated in one (1) or more Statements of Work (hereinafter “<i
            ><b>Client</b></i
          >”) (10ZING Digital and Client may be referred to individually as a
          “<i><b>Party</b></i
          >” or<i><b> </b></i>collectively as the “<i><b>Parties</b></i
          >”). The provision of digital marketing services by 10ZING Digital (as
          more fully described in the Statement of Work signed by the Parties)
          (hereinafter defined and referred to as the “<i><b>Services</b></i
          >”) is predicated upon Client’s acceptance of these Terms &amp;
          Conditions. These Terms &amp; Conditions apply to all Services
          rendered by 10ZING Digital. If Client chooses to accept these Terms
          &amp; Conditions, it must do so as written, without modification.
        </p>

        <p>
          BY SIGNING THE STATEMENT OF WORK, CLIENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE

            Services. 10ZING Digital shall provide the Services, as described in
            a Statement of Work. Specifications related to the Services may also
            be subsequently developed or amended by written agreement of the
            Parties. The Statement of Work and any specifications agreed to in
            writing by the Parties shall collectively constitute the complete
            specifications for the Services.
          </li>

          <li>
            Compensation. As compensation for the Services, Client shall pay
            10ZING Digital as indicated in the Statement of Work. Within thirty
            (30) days after submission of invoices therefor to Client, Client
            shall reimburse 10ZING Digital for all expenses that it incurs in
            performing the Services, unless such invoices set forth different
            payment terms. Client shall pay a late payment charge of 1.5 percent
            (1.5%) per month or the maximum permitted by applicable law,
            whichever is less, on all amounts remaining unpaid for a period of
            fifteen (15) days after such amounts become due and payable.

            <li>
              <i><b>10ZING Digital</b></i
              >. 10ZING Digital warrants and represents that the Services will
              be provided in a professional manner consistent with industry
              standards and meet the specifications set forth in the relevant
              Statement of Work. Client must notify 10ZING Digital of any
              warranty deficiencies within ninety (90) days from performance of
              the deficient Services. FOR ANY BREACH OF THE WARRANTY, CLIENT’S
              EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND 10ZING DIGITAL’S ENTIRE LIABILITY SHALL BE
              THE RE-PERFORMANCE OF THE DEFICIENT SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT NOT
              PROHIBITED BY LAW, THIS WARRANTY IS EXCLUSIVE AND THERE ARE NO
              OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING
              WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

            <li>
              <i><b>Client</b></i

            </li>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Any intellectual property provided to 10ZING Digital for use
                related to the Services shall be original, and that no portion
                of such violates any third-party patent, copyright, trade
                secret, or other intellectual property or other rights of Client
                or any third party.
              </li>

              <li>
                Client has the authority to enter into these Terms &amp;
                Conditions and to perform all of the obligations contained
                herein and in each Statement of Work.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </ol>

          <li>
            Grant by Client. Client hereby grants to 10ZING Digital a right and
            limited license to use any intellectual property provided to 10ZING
            Digital hereunder, including, but not limited to, trademarks,
            copyrighted works, and any and all of their attendant intellectual
            property rights, solely to perform the Services or satisfy other
            obligations under these Terms &amp; Conditions.
          </li>

          <li>Duties of Client.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Client shall approve or reject all proofs and/or proposals within
              five (5) days after Client’s receipt thereof. Client acknowledges
              that its failure to timely approve or reject proofs and/or
              proposals may prevent 10ZING Digital from being able to perform
              Services related thereto, and 10ZING Digital’s failure to provide
              any Services as a result of Client’s failure to cooperate with
              10ZING Digital shall not be considered a breach of these Terms
              &amp; Conditions by 10ZING Digital.
            </li>

            <li>
              Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold 10ZING Digital and its
              employees and agents harmless from and against any claim, loss,
              cost, damage, and expense (including, without limitation,
              reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or resulting
              from (i) any negligent, reckless, or intentionally wrongful act or
              omission of Client or Client’s agent or employee, or (ii) any
              breach or alleged breach by Client or Client’s agent or employee
              of any covenant, representation, or warranty contained in these
              Terms &amp; Conditions.
            </li>

            <li>
              Client shall not, either directly or indirectly through an
              intermediary, solicit, induce, recruit, or encourage any client,
              vendor, agent, employee, subcontractor, or other associate of
              10ZING Digital to modify its relationship with 10ZING Digital.
              Such restrictions shall apply whether Client is acting on its own
              behalf, or for the benefit of any other person or entity. If
              Client breaches this restrictive covenant then upon each such
              breach Client shall pay to 10ZING Digital upon demand the
              annualized value of the relevant relationship plus 25%. For
              example, if the relationship is that of an employee of 10ZING
              Digital and the employee renders $100,000 in Services during a
              calendar year then Client would be obligated to pay to 10ZING
              Digital $125,000.00 for its breach of this covenant.
            </li>

            <li>
              Client agrees that during the term of these Terms &amp; Conditions
              and after their termination, Client shall not, and shall ensure
              that its employees and agents do not, whether acting alone or for
              a third party, disparage the image or reputation of 10ZING Digital
              or its officers, agents, and/or affiliates. The provisions of this
              subsection 5(d) shall survive the termination of these Terms &amp;
              Conditions.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <li>Confidentiality.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>
              The Services and all information and documentation relating
              thereto shall be held in confidence by Client and its affiliates,
              agents or employees, and may not be used by Client, its agents,
              affiliates or employees, other than for the furtherance of the
              purposes of these Terms &amp; Conditions, nor shall such
              information be disclosed to third parties (except to the extent
              provided herein) without 10ZING Digital’s prior written consent.
            </li>

            <li>
              A Statement of Work may not be disclosed or made available by
              either Party hereto to third parties without the prior written
              consent of the other Party; but nothing contained herein shall
              prevent either Party from complying with applicable law,
              regulation or court order.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <li>Termination &amp; Cancellation.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>
              These Terms &amp; Conditions may be terminated/cancelled upon the
              occurrence of one (1) or more of the following events, which event
              shall also result in the termination of all active Statements of
              Work:
            </li>

            <ol>
              <li>
                By either Party, if the other Party seeks protection under the
                bankruptcy laws (other than as a creditor) or any assignment is
                made for the benefit of creditors or a trustee is appointed for
                all or any portion of such Party’s assets; or
              </li>

              <li>
                By either Party, if the other Party is in default of any
                material provision of these Terms &amp; Conditions and such
                default is not cured within thirty (30) days after receipt of
                written notice thereof by such other Party.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <li>
              If these Terms &amp; Conditions are terminated/cancelled by either
              Party pursuant to Section 7(a), all amounts payable to 10ZING
              Digital pursuant to these Terms &amp; Conditions and the
              Statement(s) of Work shall be immediately due and payable.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <li>
            Indemnities. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
            ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, EXPRESS OR
            IMPLIED, AND THERE ARE NO INDEMNIFICATIONS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF
            ANY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.
          </li>

          <li>
            Term. Unless otherwise terminated/cancelled as provided herein, the
            term of these Terms &amp; Conditions shall commence on the date set
            forth in the first Statement of Work and shall continue for a period
            of one (1) year or the date on which the Services associated with
            all Statements of Work have been fully rendered, whichever is later.
          </li>

          <li>
            Assignment. These Terms &amp; Conditions and all rights, licenses,
            or obligations hereunder may not be assigned, transferred, or
            subcontracted by either Party, except to a successor in interest of
            such Party, without the prior written consent of the other Party.
          </li>

          <li>
            Notices. All notices required to be given pursuant to these Terms
            &amp; Conditions shall be deemed given when actually delivered, if
            delivered in person, when sent, if delivered by email to the email
            address indicated in the Statement of Work, or three (3) days after
            being deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid and
            addressed to the receiving Party at the address indicated in the
            Statement of Work.
          </li>

          <li>
            Entire agreement. These Terms &amp; Conditions and the Statement(s)
            of Work constitute the entire agreement between the parties relating
            to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements,
            proposals, representations, and commitments. These Terms &amp;
            Conditions may be amended only by an instrument executed by both
            Parties.
          </li>

          <li>
            Relationship of the Parties. The Parties are and shall remain
            independent contractors. Nothing herein shall be deemed to establish
            a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between the
            Parties. Neither Party shall have the right to obligate or bind the
            other Party in any manner to any third party.
          </li>

          <li>
            Attorney Fees. In any action at law or in equity to enforce or
            interpret any provision of these Terms &amp; Conditions, the
            prevailing party shall be entitled to collect from the
            non-prevailing party, in addition to any damages and injunctive
            relief, whether at law or in equity, all reasonable costs, fees, and
            expenses, including, without limitation, attorney fees, costs, and
            expenses, expert witness fees, deposition transcript fees, postage,
            long-distance telephone charges, and travel costs.
          </li>

          <li>
            Governing law; Jurisdiction &amp; Venue. These Terms &amp;
            Conditions shall be interpreted in their entirety in accordance with
            the laws of the State of Utah, and Client agrees that the state
            courts of Utah shall have exclusive jurisdiction in any controversy
            relating to or arising out of these Terms &amp; Conditions.
          </li>

          <li>
            Equitable Relief. The parties acknowledge and agree that there may
            be no adequate remedy at law for the failure of the other party to
            comply with any of the material provisions of these Terms &amp;
            Conditions, and the parties agree that, in the event of any such
            failure, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to equitable
            relief by way of temporary restraining order, temporary injunction
            and permanent injunction and such other and further relief as any
            court of competent jurisdiction may deem proper.
          </li>

          <li>
            Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER
            FOR ANY LOST REVENUE OR INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED AS TO THE
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
          </li>

          <li>
            Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable to the other by reason
            of any failure of performance hereunder (except obligations to pay)
            if such failure arises out of causes beyond such Party’s reasonable
            control, despite the reasonable efforts, and without the fault or
            negligence of such Party. A Party experiencing such an event shall
            give as prompt notice as possible under the circumstances.
          </li>

          <li>
            Negotiation. These Terms &amp; Conditions are the result of
            negotiation between the Parties and, accordingly, shall not be
            construed more strongly for or against either party regardless of
            which Party was more responsible for the preparation of these Terms
            &amp; Conditions or any portion thereof.
          </li>

          <li>
            Surviving provisions. In the event of any expiration, termination or
